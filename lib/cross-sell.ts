/**
 * Picks what to suggest inside the cart.
 *
 * Pure and separate from the component so it can be exercised directly against
 * the real catalogue — the selection rule is the part with a decision in it,
 * and a rule that only runs inside a dialog is a rule nobody ever checks.
 *
 * The rule: never suggest what is already in the cart or out of stock, and
 * prefer a category the cart does not yet contain. Same-category suggestions
 * are substitutes — offering more tuna to someone buying tuna invites a swap,
 * not a bigger basket. They stay as a fallback so a single-category cart still
 * gets something rather than nothing.
 *
 * Order is stable: catalogue order within each group, no randomisation, so the
 * drawer does not reshuffle every time it opens.
