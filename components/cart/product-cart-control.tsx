/**
 * The catalogue card's purchase control.
 *
 * One slot with two states, driven by the cart itself rather than by local
 * state: when the product is not in the basket it offers "Agregar", and the
 * moment it is, it becomes that line's quantity — minus, figure, plus — so the
 * shopper can build the whole order without ever opening the drawer. That is
 * the weekly-pantry shopper's entire job, and it used to cost them a round trip
 * to the cart for every adjustment.
 *
 * ## Why the cart is the source of truth
 *
 * The quantity is read from the store on every render, never mirrored into
 * component state. The same product can appear twice on one screen — in the
 * grid and in the week's-catch band, or in the grid and the drawer behind it —
 * and a card holding its own copy of the number would show a stale one the
 * moment the shopper edited the other. It also means an edit made in the drawer
 * is reflected on the card underneath immediately, and that a cart restored
 * from `localStorage` on a second visit renders its quantities without a
 * reconciliation pass.
 *
 * ## Why there is no "Agregado" confirmation any more
 *
 * There was a two-second inline check on the old button. It is gone because the
 * control now *becomes* the evidence: the stepper appearing with a 1 in it says
 * everything the check said, permanently, and without a timer that fires after
 * the card has already been re-rendered by a search.
 *
 * El botón se llena de amarillo bajo el cursor. El amarillo es la mark for
 * "exceptional or fleeting", and reaching for a piece of the day's catch is
 * exactly that — see the `addOutline` variant.
 *
 * ## Why the height never changes
 *
 * Both states are 44px and full width. A card that grew or shrank when its
 * quantity changed would shift every card below it in the grid — the shopper
 * would press "+" and watch the page move under their finger.
