/**
 * ProductCard — the component the storefront lives or dies by.
 *
 * Read as a fishmonger's board rather than as a tile: a photograph mounted
 * behind a hairline, then a rule, then the name and its price on one baseline,
 * then the one thing the shopper came to do.
 *
 * The two-column baseline row is the whole idea. Price used to sit two lines
 * below the name on the left, which meant that scanning a grid of eight
 * products for "what can I afford" was eight separate reads at eight different
 * x-positions. Pinned right, the prices form a single column down the page and
 * `tabular-nums` keeps the digits from shifting between rows — which is the
 * only thing a collection page has to make easy.
 *
 * Presentation and origin drop to the second baseline under the name, still
 * paired with the unit under the price. Those two facts are what separates a
 * loin from a fillet of the same fish, so they stay on the card and are not
 * demoted to the product page.
 *
 * ## Why the card is no longer a single link
 *
 * It used to be one `<Link>` wrapping everything, which is the simplest thing
 * that works right up until the card needs a second action — and a `<button>`
 * nested inside an `<a>` is invalid HTML that browsers resolve by swallowing
 * one of the two interactions.
 *
 * So the card is a positioned container, the product name carries the link, and
 * that link stretches an empty `::after` over the whole card. The photograph and
 * the price stay clickable, the accessible name of the link is the product name
 * rather than a paragraph of card text, and the Add button sits above the
 * overlay on its own stacking level. This is the standard shape for a card with
 * one primary destination and one secondary action, and it is the only one that
 * keeps both reachable by keyboard.
 *
 * ## Why the action is visible at rest
 *
 * The design system forbids hiding purchase information behind a hover, and the
 * same reasoning applies to the purchase *control*: a button that appears on
 * hover does not exist on a phone, which is most of this shop's traffic. It is
 * `secondary` rather than `primary` because eight saturated green buttons down a
 * catalogue page would outweigh the photography the grid is built to show.
 *
 * Once the product is in the basket that slot becomes the line's own quantity —
 * see `ProductCartControl`. Both states are 44px and full width, so a row of
 * cards never reflows as quantities change.
